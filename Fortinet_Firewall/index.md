## Fortinet firewall setup
## Requirements for setting up a private firewall are a Fortinet VM image and a virtual machine.
## I'll be using VMware for my setup; to download and install the image on your device, use your browser to search for "vmware workstation pro download." This will take you to the VMware website, where you can download the appropriate executable based on your operating system (I'm using Windows).
