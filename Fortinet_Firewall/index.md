## Fortinet firewall setup
## The Requirements for setting up a private firewall are a Fortinet VM image and a virtual machine.
## I'll be using VMware for my setup; to download and install the image on your device, use your browser to search for "vmware workstation pro download." This will take you to the VMware website, where you can download the appropriate executable based on your operating system (I'm using Windows).
## The next step is to download the free Fortinet VMimage from the "support.fortinet.com" support website, register, log in, and hover over "VM images" to select the necessary image based on your virtual environment (Fortinet supports many different virtual environments, including cloud platforms). Once you select the necessary virtual machine image, you will be presented with two options: an upgrade version and a new deployment image. Download the new deployment image to initiate a fresh Fortigate setup; the upgrade version is intended for users who currently have an installed firewall and wish to update to the most recent version.

## Installing, configuring, and importing the virtual machine's image are the next steps. If the Fortigate VM image is in a compressed file, be sure to decompress it, change the storage location when importing the file, or leave it at default, and give it a name.
